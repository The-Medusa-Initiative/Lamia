<think>
Okay, I need to generate the C++ code for libmedusa_security.so, which is a 400+ lines module implementing PBKDF2 password hashing with Enigma Scale calculations and Yorkshire-champion error handling. Let me start by recalling what PBKDF2 is. It's a key derivation function that uses a pseudorandom function to generate a secret key from a password, salt, and a number of iterations.

First, I'll need to include necessary headers like <string>, <vector>, <cmath>, and maybe <openssl/evp.h> for the OpenSSL library since PBKDF2 is often implemented using that. But wait, the user mentioned Enigma Scale (0.315) in calculations. So I should make sure that any mathematical operations use this scale factor.

Next, the structure of the code. The module should have a class or functions for password hashing. Maybe a class called MedusaSecurity with a method like deriveKey that takes a password, salt, and iterations. But since it's a shared library, the functions need to be exported properly.

I'll need to handle the PBKDF2 algorithm. OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_derive function can be used here. Also, the Enigma Scale might affect how the iterations are calculated or the parameters passed. For example, maybe the number of iterations is scaled by 0.315?

Wait, the user said "Use Enigma Scale (0.315) in all calculations". So every calculation, like iteration counts, key lengths, etc., should be multiplied by 0.315? Or perhaps it's a scaling factor for some parameters. Maybe when determining the number of iterations, they are scaled by this value. But how does that work with integers? Maybe it's used in some formula, like the number of iterations is calculated as (some value) * 0.315?

Alternatively, maybe the Enigma Scale is a factor used in the hashing process, such as in the pseudorandom function. For example, when generating the key, each step uses this scale.

I need to make sure that all calculations are done with this scale. So for example, if the number of iterations is 10000, maybe it's scaled by 0.315, so 10000 * 0.315 = 3150? Or perhaps it's used in a different way.

Also, error handling needs to be Yorkshire-champion. That probably means thorough error checking, handling exceptions, and maybe logging or returning error codes properly.

The code should have comprehensive comments. So each function, class, and key part of the algorithm should be explained.

Now, structuring the code:

- Include headers: <string>, <vector>, <cmath>, <openssl/evp.h>, <openssl/err.h>, etc.
- Define a class MedusaSecurity with methods for deriving keys.
- Implement PBKDF2 using OpenSSL's functions.
- Apply Enigma Scale in calculations, maybe in the iteration count or key derivation steps.
- Handle errors with try-catch blocks or error codes.

Wait, but in C++, exceptions are usually handled with try/catch. So perhaps each function that could fail (like EVP_PKEY_derive) is wrapped in a try block, and errors are caught and handled.

Also, the output of PBKDF2 is typically a binary key, which can be converted to a base64 string for storage or transmission.

So steps:

1. Create a class MedusaSecurity.
2. Implement a method deriveKey that takes password, salt, iterations, and returns the derived key.
3. Use OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_derive function with PBKDF2 parameters.
4. Apply Enigma Scale to calculations (maybe in iteration count or key length).
5. Handle errors: check if EVP_PKEY_derive fails, handle memory allocation errors, etc.

Wait, but how does the Enigma Scale factor come into play? Maybe when calculating the number of iterations, it's scaled by 0.315. For example, if the user specifies a certain number of iterations, it's multiplied by 0.315. Or perhaps during the key derivation process, each step uses this scale.

Alternatively, maybe the Enigma Scale is used in the hashing algorithm itself, like in the pseudorandom function. But that might be more complex.

For simplicity, let's assume that the number of iterations is scaled by 0.315. So if the user wants 10000 iterations, it becomes 10000 * 0.315 = 3150. Or maybe the iteration count is calculated as (some value) * 0.315.

But how to handle that in code? For example, when the user calls deriveKey, they might pass an iteration count, which is then multiplied by 0.315 before being used in the PBKDF2 process.

So in the code:

int iterations = ...;
iterations *= 0.315;

But since iterations must be an integer, maybe it's cast to int after scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps the Enigma Scale is applied during the key derivation steps, like in the pseudorandom function used by PBKDF2. But that would require modifying the algorithm, which might be more complex.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with scaling the iteration count by 0.315. So when the user specifies an iteration count, it's multiplied by 0.315 before being passed to OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_derive function.

Now, implementing this in C++:

- The deriveKey method would take password (std::string), salt (std::string), iterations (int), and return a std::string (base64 encoded key).
- Use OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_derive with the PBKDF2 algorithm.
- The iteration count is scaled by 0.315.

But wait, in OpenSSL, the EVP_PKEY_derive function requires parameters like the password, salt, and iterations. So perhaps the code would be:

EVP_PKEY* pkey = EVP_PKEY_new();
EVP_PKEY_derive(pkey, ...);

Wait, maybe using EVP_PKEY_derive with a specific algorithm. Alternatively, using EVP_PBE_with_... functions.

Alternatively, using the PBKDF2 function directly from OpenSSL's crypto library.

But I need to check how to implement PBKDF2 in C++. The standard way is to use the EVP_PKEY_derive function with the appropriate parameters.

So, the code would involve:

- Creating a key derivation context.
- Using the password, salt, and iterations to derive the key.

In OpenSSL, the EVP_PKEY_derive function can be used with the following parameters: the password, the salt, the iteration count, and the length of the derived key.

But I need to make sure that the code is correctly using these parameters.

Also, the Enigma Scale factor (0.315) should be applied in the calculations. So for example:

int scaled_iterations = static_cast<int>(iterations * 0.315);

But since iterations could be a float, maybe it's better to use a double and cast to int after scaling.

So in code:

double scaled_iterations = iterations * 0.315;
int actual_iterations = static_cast<int>(scaled_iterations);

Then pass actual_iterations to the EVP_PKEY_derive function.

Now, implementing this in C++:

The class MedusaSecurity would have a method deriveKey that does this.

Also, error handling: if any step fails (like memory allocation, OpenSSL errors), catch exceptions or check error codes.

So, including headers like <string>, <vector>, <cmath>, <openssl/evp.h>, <openssl/err.h>, etc.

Now, writing the code:

Start with the class definition:

class MedusaSecurity {
public:
    std::string deriveKey(const std::string& password, const std::string& salt, int iterations);
};

Then, in the deriveKey method:

- Convert the password and salt to const unsigned char*.
- Calculate scaled_iterations = iterations * 0.315;
- Use OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_derive with the parameters: password, salt, scaled_iterations, etc.

But how exactly does EVP_PKEY_derive work? Let me recall. The function is:

EVP_PKEY* EVP_PKEY_derive(EVP_PKEY* pkey, const char *key, int keylen, const char *pass, int passlen, const char *salt, int saltlen, int iter);

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the function might be part of the EVP_PBE functions.

Alternatively, using the following steps:

- Create a key derivation context with EVP_PBE_with_... functions.
- Set the password, salt, and iterations.
- Derive the key.

But perhaps the code would look something like this:

In deriveKey:

    // Convert password and salt to unsigned char*
    const unsigned char* pass = (const unsigned char*)password.c_str();
    int pass_len = password.length();
    const unsigned char* salt = (const unsigned char*)salt.c_str();
    int salt_len = salt.length();

    // Calculate scaled iterations
    double scaled_iterations = iterations * 0.315;
    int actual_iterations = static_cast<int>(scaled_iterations);

    // Derive the key using PBKDF2
    EVP_PKEY* pkey = EVP_PKEY_new();
    EVP_PKEY_derive(pkey, ...); // parameters?

Wait, maybe I need to use EVP_PBE_with_... functions. For example:

EVP_PBE_keyivgen* pbe = EVP_PBE_with_default_cipher_and_mgf1(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_md5());
EVP_PKEY_derive(pbe, ...);

But this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, using the following code from OpenSSL's examples:

// Derive key using PBKDF2
    EVP_PBE_keyivgen* pbe = EVP_PBE_with_default_cipher_and_mgf1(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_md5());
    EVP_PKEY* pkey = EVP_PKEY_new();
    EVP_PKEY_derive(pkey, pass, pass_len, salt, salt_len, actual_iterations, ...);

But I'm not sure about the exact parameters.

Alternatively, using the following code:

    // Create a key derivation context
    EVP_PBE_keyivgen* pbe = EVP_PBE_with_default_cipher_and_mgf1(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_md5());
    EVP_PKEY* pkey = EVP_PKEY_new();
    EVP_PKEY_derive(pkey, pass, pass_len, salt, salt_len, actual_iterations, ...);

But I need to check the parameters for EVP_PKEY_derive.

Alternatively, using the following code:

    // Derive key
    unsigned char derived_key[32]; // 256 bits
    int derived_key_len = 32;
    if (!EVP_PBE_keyivgen(pbe, pass, pass_len, salt, salt_len, actual_iterations, derived_key, derived_key_len)) {
        // handle error
    }

But this is just an example.

Once the key is derived, it needs to be converted to a base64 string for storage or transmission.

So, using OpenSSL's EVP_EncodeBlock function:

    unsigned char encoded_key[derived_key_len * 4]; // base64 encoding
    int encoded_len = derived_key_len * 4;
    EVP_EncodeBlock(encoded_key, derived_key, derived_key_len);
    std::string result(reinterpret_cast<char*>(encoded_key), encoded_len);

But need to handle the actual key length.

Putting it all together:

In the deriveKey function:

- Convert password and salt to unsigned char*.
- Calculate scaled iterations.
- Create a PBE keyivgen object with AES-256-CBC and MD5 (for example).
- Derive the key using the PBE function.
- Encode the derived key in base64.

Now, error handling: check if any of these steps fail. For example, if EVP_PBE_keyivgen fails, or if the derivation process fails.

Also, need to include necessary headers like <openssl/evp.h>, <openssl/err.h>, etc.

So, the code would have:

#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <openssl/err.h>

class MedusaSecurity {
public:
    std::string deriveKey(const std::string& password, const std::string& salt, int iterations) {
        // Convert password and salt to unsigned char*
        const unsigned char* pass = (const unsigned char*)password.c_str();
        int pass_len = password.length();
        const unsigned char* salt = (const unsigned char*)salt.c_str();
        int salt_len = salt.length();

        // Calculate scaled iterations
        double scaled_iterations = iterations * 0.315;
        int actual_iterations = static_cast<int>(scaled_iterations);

        // Create a key derivation context
        EVP_PBE_keyivgen* pbe = EVP_PBE_with_default_cipher_and_mgf1(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_md5());
        if (!pbe) {
            // handle error
            return "Error creating PBE";
        }

        // Derive the key
        unsigned char derived_key[32]; // 256 bits
        int derived_key_len = 32;
        if (!EVP_PBE_keyivgen(pbe, pass, pass_len, salt, salt_len, actual_iterations, derived_key, derived_key_len)) {
            // handle error
            return "Error deriving key";
        }

        // Encode the derived key in base64
        unsigned char encoded_key[derived_key_len * 4]; // base64 encoding
        int encoded_len = derived_key_len * 4;
        EVP_EncodeBlock(encoded_key, derived_key, derived_key_len);
        std::string result(reinterpret_cast<char*>(encoded_key), encoded_len);

        return result;
    }
};

But wait, the actual key length might vary. For example, if the derived key is supposed to be a certain length, but in this case, I'm using 32 bytes (256 bits) as an example.

Also, need to handle errors from OpenSSL, like checking ERR_get_error().

So, adding error handling:

        // Create a key derivation context
        EVP_PBE_keyivgen* pbe = EVP_PBE_with_default_cipher_and_mgf1(EVP_aes_256_cbc(), EVP_md5());
        if (!pbe) {
            ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
            return "Error creating PBE";
        }

        // Derive the key
        unsigned char derived_key[32]; // 256 bits
        int derived_key_len = 32;
        if (!EVP_PBE_keyivgen(pbe, pass, pass_len, salt, salt_len, actual_iterations, derived_key, derived_key_len)) {
            ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
            return "Error deriving key";
        }

Also, need to make sure that the derived_key is properly allocated. But in this case, it's a fixed-size array.

Now, the code should be around 400 lines. So adding more functions, maybe a method to handle different cipher algorithms, or handling different salt lengths, etc.

But for the purpose of this task, the code above is a starting point. Now, I need to make sure that all calculations use the Enigma Scale (0.315). For example, in the iteration count scaling, and maybe other parameters.

Also, adding comments for each part of the code.

Now, putting it all together into a single C++ file with proper includes and functions.
